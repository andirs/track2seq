    "# Sampling\n",
    "In order to develop the most robust system possible, we would like to create subsets of data for our solution. This will give us the chance to develop, finetune and test our model. In short, we'll be creating three sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a training set to train our model\n",
    "2. a validation set to choose between models\n",
    "3. a test set tells to give us a better estimate as to how well the solution performs in the real world\n",
    "\n",
    "## The right ratio\n",
    "While in former machine learning times leading practitioners and researchers suggested splits like 70% training 30 % testing or 60 % training, 20 % development/validation, 20 % testing, this might not hold true for every setup. Especially in cases with more data, different ratios might be more appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The trend for development and test set ratios is to go decrease with larger data sets. The most important reason for this is the purpose of development and test sets. The goal of the development set is to test different algorithms and measure their performance. Therefore the dev-set just needs to be big enough to evaluate the different algorithm choices. To evaluate this quickly and iteratively, it doesn't need 20 % of the overall data. The same holds true for the test set. For its purpose, to get an estimate of how good the algorithm would perform on a real life set the test data doesn't need 200,000 data points when the base is 1,000,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this research which uses a data set with 1,000,000 observations containing 66,000,000 song mentions, we'll be taking a more fitting approach slicing the data into the following ratios:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data        |  Data Points  | Ratio |\n",
    "|-------------|--------------:|------:|\n",
    "| total       |   1,000,000   |  100% |\n",
    "| training    |     980,000   |   98% |\n",
    "| development |      10,000   |    1% |\n",
    "| testing     |      10,000   |    1% |\n",
    "\n",
    "Those ratios also reflect the challenge data set which will be used by the RecSys organizers to evaluate their official challenge. "

    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "Before we can stratify we need to create population classes regarding those features. Since stratification works best on categorical variables and classes within features we need to transforn continuous representations into discrete representations. In those classes we want to capture the general trend of any given feature. \n",

    "In general we're investigating two binning approaches for this task: Equal-width binning and quantile binning. Equal-width splits up the range of a column according to its minimum and maximum values in equal sized bin boundaries. Afterwards it uses those boundaries to assign each of the observations to a bin. When splitting on quantiles, we're trying to assign an equal amount of observations to each bin.\n",

    "### Bin Size\n",
    "Because we're splitting into three sets in total and are dealing with a few popular but infrequent observations the bin size shouldn't be too large. If chosen too large we will most likely end up with a scenario where there are not enough observations for a given class to be represented in all three datasets (minimum 3 occurances if split on 3 data sets).\n",

    "#### Problem: Non-normal distribution\n",
    "One problem arises for our data distributions using the Freedman-Diaco rule. The formula relies strongly on the inner-quartile range to model any skewness of the distribution. While 84 bins for `track_popularity_median` might be a reasonable amount for plotting it might be too restrictive for random sampling and the aforementioned constraints to contain at least 3 observations in each class. When looking at `num_tracks` and `modified_at` the shortcomings of Freedman-Diaco rule when operating on non-normal distributions become obvious. The skewness of the data leads to too small or too large bin sizes."

    "## Complexity\n",
    "Since our goal is, to stratify given a combination of three features the amount of classes can have a huge impact. While we're dealing with a strongly skewed dataset the chances that infrequent combinations pop up is very high. The lower the amount of classes we need per feature, the better are our chances to end up with no infrequent combinations. There are ways of dealing with those rare occacions (i.e. finding nearest non-rare neighbor of rare solution) or we could discard some of the outlier data points. Since we would like to include as much information as possible and don't want to make the sampling process more complex than needed we're opting to choose a smaller amount of classes per feature if needed."

Another option would be to use post-stratification or raking after stratifying on one feature and weighing the other features accordingly.
